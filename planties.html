      biennial vegetable in the family Brassicaceae grown 
      for its edible head. There are many different varieties 
      of cabbage which include the white and red cabbage 
      (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) and the savoy cabbage 
      (Brassica oleracea var. sabauda. The head of the cabbage 
      is round and forms on a short thick stem. The leaves are 
      thick and alternating with wavy or lobed edges and the 
      roots are are fibrous and shallow. The plant produces
        large yellow flowers. The densely leaved heads can range 
       in size from 0.5 to 3.6 kg (1-8 lb) depending on variety.
